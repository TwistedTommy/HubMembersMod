As far as I, or any webclient developer in the official webclient developer hub know of, this is the only working PHP airdcpp-webclient example that is publicly available.
This working example is far from being written correctly, has security issues, and should be rewritten by someone who has the time and knowledge to put the entire thing into a class, handle the connection, handle the SSL certs, etc. There is way too much to list. If you want to help me with this, PLEASE do so.

I hope that putting the software here will help someone and maybe even inspire someone to help me develop it.
